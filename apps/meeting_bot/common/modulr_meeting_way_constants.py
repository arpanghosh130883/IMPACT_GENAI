    ### Modulr Meeting Way    

    The Modulr Meeting Way is a set of principles for having effective meetings

    ### Your meeting, should you choose to accept it...

    - Always actively respond to a meeting invite with an acceptance or decline

    - Constructively challenge if you think outcomes could be achieved another more effective way, instead of a meeting, to ensure the best use of everyone’s time

    - If you’re the organiser, always send an agenda in advance to all participants - with clear outcomes to be achieved in the meeting included

    - Review the attendee list before booking the meeting, ensuring you’ll have the right people in the meeting to achieve the outcomes you’ve set

    ### Synchronise watches...

    - Ensure you arrive on time for a meeting – and if you can’t, message the meeting organiser to let them know

    - Avoid over-running or continuing to stay in meeting rooms after your booked slot

    - If you’re the organiser, check meeting times work for all attendees – for example, when arranging meetings later or earlier in the day, check times work for colleagues in other time zones or those who have outside commitments that meetings may clash with

    - Try to limit meetings to either 25 or 50 minutes as far as possible to give people a break in-between meetings

    ### Time to debrief...

    - Review the agenda outcomes at the end of every meeting to make sure you’ve achieved everything you set out to

    - Use Teams for a transcript or recording – and turn this into a handy summary for all participants using our Gen AI-powered Modulr Meetings Way tool

    - If you’re the organiser, make sure you review the summary first before sending to ensure it is accurate and includes any actions, with assigned owners and deadlines for completion.

    ---

    By adhering to these principles, we can ensure our meetings are productive, efficient, and a valuable use of everyone's time.

    #### Overview

    The Modulr Meetings Way is a set of meeting rules that will make all meetings at Modulr run more efficiently and effectively.  

    To make adoption of these rules easier, we’re rolling out safe and secure Generative AI-powered tools for your convenience.

    Summarise A Meeting – Summarises meeting transcripts into concise notes and action items, ready for sharing.  

    Create An Agenda – Works with you to create an agenda to get the most out of your meeting. Remember, you should always send an agenda in advance to all participants.

    #### How To Create An Agenda

    1. Visit the Modulr Meeting Way on Snowflake. Access is safe and secure behind SSO, and all usage is confidential

    2. Simply share a Title of your meeting. Remember, meeting names can be useful to let others know the purpose of the meeting to ensure they are prepared!

    3. The Agenda creator will guide you to a build out agenda aligned to the Modulr Meeting Way!

    4. Update the calendar event and share with participants!

    #### How to Summarise A Meeting

    1. To use the Summarise A Meeting tool, you must first ensure the meeting is transcribed! Select “Start Transcription” within the Teams meeting (see further instructions below). Whilst Microsoft has built in consent controls (cameras and microphones need to be turned on after transcription), remember it’s still best practice to ensure meeting participants are happy for the meeting to be transcribed!

    2. After the meeting, the meeting organiser can download the transcript in docx format going to the Teams Chat.

    3. This transcript can be uploaded to the Summarise A Meeting App, using the “Upload a File” button. Alternatively, the transcript can be copied and pasted directly.

    4. The bot will then guide you through creating notes. Feel free to provide feedback (e.g. add 5 more bullet points of details) to augment the response!

    5. The notes can then be copied and pasted and shared with the Meeting Participants!

    #### Top Tips 

    - Only transcribed meetings can be summarised (so remember to turn transcription on!). 

    - Teams can still be used to transcribe in person meetings!

    - Use names! Names will help action items be picked up within the transcription. 

    - Describe visual content shared on screen: The AI will not at present be exposed to what’s shown visually. It's best if the presenter verbally reads out important points from a slide, key data, or explaining a process that's being demonstrated.

    - Sense check responses! You are responsible for reviewing the output before sharing.

    - Remember, being clear will not only help those in the room, but also the bot in pulling out these details! Consider recapping action items, defining acronyms and speaking clearly. 

    #### Guidance : When to Use It 

    - Initial roll out for use with internal meetings only and where all participants are happy for the meeting to be transcribed.

    - As agreed within the Modulr Meeting Way, meetings should be followed up with notes and action items. Use your best efforts to adopt this way of working, whether using these tools or otherwise. 

    #### How To Transcribe A Meeting

    - Within a Teams Meeting, select “More” from the menu, then “Record and transcribe” from the sub-menu.

    - Then select “Start Transcription”

    - Participants will need to unmute their microphone’s and turn on their camera’s for the transcription to provide consent

    #### Application Usage And Security

    - Your inputs and the model's outputs are not visible or stored by Modulr. 

    - Our system is secured with Snowflake's SSO and uses Microsoft Azure OpenAI services. Sensitive information can be shared with these applications.

    - We track usage volume (time and user ID) to understand how the tool is being adopted and which features are successful. 

    - Whilst Modulr does not track contents, Microsoft does automate the monitoring of usage for system abuse. If content is flagged as abusive, authorized Microsoft employees may review it within 30 days. You can find more details [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/abuse-monitoring).
